It is often necessary to have multiple instances running side by side to increase throughput or reliability of your system. This page shows how
this can be achieved.

Before considering clustering for performance reasons it is recommended to [[doc:process:dev:tuning|tune your system]] and understand it's performance characteristics. Ideally
an application can serve most requests from cache and this can have dramatic effects on necessary hardware to support a given load.
