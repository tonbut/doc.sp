It is good idea to use version control to manage your own NetKernel modules.

==SVN==
Subversion works naturally with NetKernel because each sub-directory/module can be versioned and branched independently. 

==Git==
Github makes using git easy. However using NetKernel with git best practice is to use one repository per module. This could become
cumbersome.
