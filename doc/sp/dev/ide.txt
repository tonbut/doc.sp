The Integrated Development Environments (IDE) has become an essential tool for the developer. It provides a workbench from where
all common activities can be performed - a one stop shop. Activities usually include:
* Editing code
* Managing version control
* Running tests
* Debugging code

The section includes guides on setting up common IDEs for use with NetKernel.
