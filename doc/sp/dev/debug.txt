==Visualizer==
Typically a developer working in the ROC domain will use the visualizer to debug applications 

==Other useful tools==
* Requests and Threads - shows all executing requests, and the threads that are executing them. More useful than a Java thread dump because a coherent view across logical requests and physical threads is shown.
* Request Trace - inject test requests and see how they resolve and are evaluated.
* Class Trace - help diagnose how classes are located through the classloader hierarchy

==Java Debugger==
The Java debugger can also be used.
