If you have any statically compiled programming languages within your modules these will need to be
compiled by you build script. Otherwise building may be as simple a taking your module source from
[[doc:process:dev:versioning|version control]] and putting into a jar module. If you are using [[doc:process:prod:repository|Apposite Repository]] then you may want
to create packages to contain one or more modules.

=Distribution=
For distribution and deployment, a module is packaged in a ".jar" file.
While a module jar file may have any name, by convention the filename
uses the module's URN identifier in dotted form.
For example, if the module's urn is

{literal}urn:org:netkernel:some:module{/literal}

and has a version 1.0.0. The jarred file name will be

{literal}urn.org.netkernel.some.module-1.0.0.jar{/literal}

The use of periods (".") in the filename instead of colons (":") is required as some operating systems
cannot cope with a colon in a filename.
